Docker hub link: https://hub.docker.com/r/p3xu/my_first_dhub_project

Used the project from previous exercise, but as development version because I wasn't sure about pushing it with those auth key settings that I had to make to get the production version working. 
Attached also the Dockerfile, which was used to build the image for docker hub. 

Images readme:

This image contains the Simple clicker app by University of Helsinki's course, DevOps with Docker. The link to the original project: https://github.com/docker-hy/rails-example-project

To run the container, just use the command:

docker run -d p3xu/my_first_dhub_project:latest

The project is running as development version and in port 3000/tcp.
